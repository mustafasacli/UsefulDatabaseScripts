ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return clob as
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    return stmt;

end exec_immediate;
/
create table tq84_test(a number);
The following statement throws a ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query error message:
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
Compile the function with pragma autonomous_transaction …
create or replace function exec_immediate(stmt clob) return clob as
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
begin

    execute immediate stmt;
    return stmt;

end exec_immediate;
/
… and try again. This time, it throws ORA-06519: active autonomous transaction detected and rolled back.
select
   exec_immediate('insert into tq84_test values(42)')
from
   dual;
